	\begin{itemize}
		\item signals in every bunch of the beam
		\item most dominant peak (@\,\SI{\sim85}{\nano\second}) \ra triggered signal
		\item no signals in pre-trigger bunch due to trigger dead time
		\item use this region to measure noise

	\begin{itemize}
		\item find the triggered peak by max value
		\item signal: integrate asymmetrically around the peak
		\item noise: same integration window in centre of pre-trigger bunch
		\item final pulse height: signal - pedestal integral event by event
