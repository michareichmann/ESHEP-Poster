	\begin{itemize}
		\item noise distribution agrees well with Gaussian even at high rates
		\item extract noise by taking the sigma of the Gaussian fit
		\item signal distribution Landau shaped
		\begin{itemize}
			\item widened due to superimposition of many Landaus from different regions in the poly crystal
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item regions with different pulse heights in pCVD diamond
		\item signals corresponding to wide Landau
		\item rate scaled to the mean
		\item pulse height very stable after irradiation
	\end{itemize}
