	\begin{itemize}
		\item pixel readout chip provides pixel hits with pulse height
		\item need to apply cuts to select meaningful events
		\item cuts applied in order of the following table
	\end{itemize}

	\small{
		\nicetab{ll}{ \textbf{Cut} & \textbf{Excluded Events} 													\\\hline
			event range					& first minute of the run due to various beam conditions 	\\
			beam interruptions	& during rate changes of the beam due to beam interruption\\
			aligned 						& DUT and Telescope are not aligned (event-wise)					\\
			trigger phase				& Chip trigger timing is incorrect 												\\
			tracks							& not all telescope planes have exactly one cluster				\\
			chi2 (x/y)					& badly fit tracks (\SI{>50}{\%\, quantile})							\\
			track slope (x/y)		& large angles of the tracks (\SI{>2}{deg})								\\
			rhit								& large DUT residual (\SI{>100}{\milli\meter})						\\
			pixel mask					& noisy pixels																						\\
			fiducial						& not in selected (fiducial) area of the DUT							\\}}
